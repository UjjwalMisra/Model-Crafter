# Model-Crafter – Train & Evaluate ML Models  

## 🚀 Overview  
Model-Crafter is a Python-based tool that allows users to upload datasets, choose machine learning algorithms, and receive detailed accuracy metrics along with visualizations. It supports both classification and regression tasks.  

## 🔹 Features  
- 📂 Upload and preprocess datasets (handle missing values, categorical encoding)  
- 🤖 Train and evaluate ML models (classification & regression)  
- 📊 Visualize results (confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importance, correlation heatmap)  
- 🏆 Supports Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, ANN, XGBoost, and more  
- 🎯 Automatically splits data into training and testing sets  

## 🛠 Installation  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ujjwalmisra/Model-Crafter.git
cd Model-Crafter
pip install -r requirements.txt
